Task Management App
Overview
This Android app allows users to manage a list of tasks with features such as adding new tasks, editing existing ones, marking tasks as completed, and persisting changes locally using Room Database. The app integrates with Firebase to track key events like task addition, editing, and completion. It also monitors network performance and handles crashes effectively using Firebase Crashlytics.

Features
API Integration:

Fetches a list of tasks using a mock API or a local sample JSON response.
Task Management:

Displays tasks in a RecyclerView or LazyColumn.
Users can add, edit, and mark tasks as completed.
Task changes are persisted locally in a Room Database.
Firebase Integration:

Firebase Analytics to track key events:
Task Added
Task Edited
Task Completed
Firebase Performance Monitoring to track network performance.
Firebase Crashlytics to report crashes, including network and database-related crashes.
UI/UX Design:

Follows Material Design principles.
Displays meaningful error and success messages.
Code Quality:

Built using modern Android architecture (MVVM).
Modular, testable codebase with well-structured components.
Requirements
Android Studio (latest stable version)
Firebase account for Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, and Performance Monitoring
Room Database for local task persistence
Installation
Step 1: Clone the repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-app.git
cd task-management-app
Step 2: Open the project in Android Studio
Open Android Studio.
Click on "Open an existing project" and navigate to the project folder.
Step 3: Set up Firebase
Create a new project in Firebase (https://console.firebase.google.com/).
Add Firebase to your Android project by following the instructions on Firebase's console.
Enable Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, and Performance Monitoring in the Firebase console.
Download the google-services.json file from Firebase and place it in the app/ directory of your project.
Sync your project with Firebase by ensuring the google-services plugin is applied in your build.gradle files.
Step 4: Build and Run the app
Open Android Studio and sync the project to download all dependencies.
Build the app and run it on your emulator or physical device.
Features and Functionality
Fetching Tasks:

The app fetches task data from a mock API or local JSON file using Retrofit or a similar networking library.
Task Management:

Add New Tasks: Users can add new tasks by providing a task description and setting a status (e.g., active or completed).
Edit Existing Tasks: Users can update task details, including description and status.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed by toggling a checkbox or changing the status.
Persistence:

Task data is persisted locally using Room Database. Changes are saved locally and can be accessed even when the app is closed.
Firebase Analytics:

Analytics events are logged for the following user actions:
Task Added
Task Edited
Task Completed
Firebase Performance Monitoring:

Monitors and logs network performance, including fetch times for task data.
Crashlytics:

Firebase Crashlytics will catch and log both expected and unexpected app crashes, including network and database-related issues.
UI/UX Design
The app follows Material Design principles for all UI components.
Responsive layouts for various screen sizes.
Meaningful error messages are displayed when tasks cannot be added, edited, or fetched.
Architecture
This app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

Model: Handles the data layer, including API calls and Room database operations.
View: Displays the UI using RecyclerView (or LazyColumn) for task list and allows users to interact with tasks.
ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the View and Model layers. It provides data to the UI and handles user actions.
Libraries and Tools Used
Room Database: Local database for persisting task data.
Retrofit: For making network calls to fetch tasks.
Firebase Analytics: To track key events in the app.
Firebase Crashlytics: For crash reporting.
Firebase Performance Monitoring: For tracking network performance.
Material Components: For UI elements following Material Design principles.
Troubleshooting
App Crashes on Launch:

Ensure the google-services.json file is correctly added to the app/ directory.
Make sure that Firebase is correctly set up in the Firebase console and linked to the app.
Network Fetch Failures:

Check your internet connection or mock API server status.
Ensure Retrofit or network library configuration is correct.
